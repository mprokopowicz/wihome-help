  "xopis": "<p>Controls the alarm system. Converts the input signals from any sensor elements (keys) or logical encryption elements.<p>The alarm is armed by sending a signal from a sensor element (key) to the appropriate input.<p>Once armed, the alarm returns a signal at its output. The time required to arm the alarm is set individually for each motion sensor cooperating with it. The longest period set for a given motion sensor will be the period needed to set the alarm. (Motion sensor>Installer Settings>alarm delay).\n<p>The alarm will be armed when the motion sensors cooperating with it do not detect a presence or if the detected presence does not qualify, e.g. if a delayed alarm is set for a motion sensor.<p>When the alarm is armed, the element returns a signal to the \"alarm is armed\" output.<p>The alarm will not be armed if a presence is detected during the arming period, or if the area covered by the motion sensors is not vacated within the delay period set for those particular sensors. In this event, a signal will be returned to the output signalling a fault in the arming of the alarm.<p>If the alarm is not ready for arming, e,g, if the motion sensor cooperating with the alarm detects a presence, a signal is returned to the output.<p>The arming period can be reduced so that it is immediate by connecting the switch for closed front doors to the appropriate output.<p>In the event of a threat, the alarm system can be set off by connecting the switch to the panic output.<p>The alarm is disactivated by sending a signal from the sensor elements (keys) or the logical elements that encrypt disactivation.<p>When in second mode, the <a href=\"../../17/17.16/16.html\">rH-P1</a>motion sensor can act in alarm mode for the entire building by cooperating with the SX 600 controller.<br><center><img src=\"600_MO.jpg\"></center><p>When no delay in arming the alarm is set for the motion sensor, the detection of a presence will arm it and if the alarm is already armed, it will sound immediately.<p>For a motion sensor set with a delay, disarming the alarm must take place before the period has elapsed, otherwise it will be treated as an intrusion and the alarm will be set off.",
