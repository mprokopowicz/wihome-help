  "schemat": "This example shows how a LED coder can be used to signal on the remote control what action was carried out when the button was pressed. The remote control switches the selected circuits on the rH-R3 on or off. The green diode will start to flash on switching on, while the red diode will start to flash on switching on. In order that information from all 3 circuits don't disturb the functioning of the diodes, a number of appropriate logic connections were constructed. The information about the state of the relevant SX 820 switch is read only at the instant that the button is pressed, then the logical SX 805 key is closed at the input of the corresponding coloured diode and the LED coder is activated.",
