It cooperates with all the motion detectors throughout the building and it receives signals from them if a presence is detected. It has a binary output that signals a presence.<p>The range of detection depends on which operating mode is selected: room, floor, entire building or externally.<p>The time to generate a presence signal is set by the installer and this is the period over which a signal will be generated at the element output after the last detection of a presence by the motion sensor.",
