  "xopis_naglowek": "MODULE DESCRIPTION:",
  "xopis_sprzet": "<b>rH-R3S3</b>is a combination of three relays and three contact outputs. The module sends out information about the opening or closing of the contacts to the system and it controls the relays that can activate any electrical circuit. Communication with the server takes place by radio.<p>The module has three physical inputs for the connection of monostable and potential free contacts, as well as three relay inputs. The power load on the contacts can be resistive, inductive or capacitive in both AC and DC circuits. An integral temperature sensor protects the unit against overheating. <p>Pressing the switch on the housing for less than 1s activates or deactivates all the relays simultaneously.<p><p><b>AUTONOMOUS MODE:</ b><p>If the module loses connection with the server, it goes into autonomous mode. Briefly pressing the switch connected to contacts 1, 2 or 3 activates or deactivates the first, second or third relay respectively.<p>Conditions for autonomous mode:<ul><li>Correct connection of the S1, S2 and S3 contacts with the switch</ li><li> The \"Off-line: autonomous mode\" option in the Installer Settings is enabled.</li></ul><p>The object has two operating modes - the second mode is analagous to the first for a dual-channel relay with a dual channel transmitter (a mode for maintaining compatibility with a discontinued module)</p>",
  "xopis": "rH-R3S3 has an object that consists of three inputs and three binary (two state) relay outputs that are separate for each physical input.<p>The object input controls the relay channels, and the operating state of each channel is returned to the output.<p>The element also has three inputs and three binary outputs (two state) that are separate for each physical input. Opening or closing of the contact changes the logic state at the corresponding output.",

Transport, storage and method of use of the module will affect its correct functioning. Installation of the module is not recommended if there are missing parts or the module is damaged or deformed.
