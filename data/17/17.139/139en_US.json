  "xopis_sprzet": "<p>rH-PWM2S2 is a combination of two power regulators and two contact inputs. The module sends information about the opening or closing of the contacts to the system and controls two low voltage receivers powered from an external source (max. 24V).</p><p>The module has two electrical inputs for the connection of two monostable potential free contacts, as well as two inputs for the connection of receivers. Power control takes place by the modulation of the width of the pulse that switches on the receiver (PWM) and the impulse frequency is set in the range 100Hz to 1kHz. The integral temperature sensor protects the module from overheating. Communication with the server takes place by radio.</p><p>rH-PWM2S2 is particularly suitable for control of LEDs, activating electromagnetic locks and other low voltage actuators.</p><p><b>AUTOMATIC MODE</b></p><p>If the module loses contact with the server, it goes into autonomous work mode and starts to work as a classic dimmer. Briefly pressing the switch connected to contacts 1 or 2 turns the first or second PWM output on or off respectively. Pressing it for a longer period increases/decreases the power at intervals of 10%, in the range 10-100%.<p>Conditions for autonomous mode: <ul><li>Correct connection of the S1 or S2 contacts with the switch</li><li>The \"Off-line: autonomous mode\" function is set correctly in the Installer Settings</li></ul>",
  "xopis": "The rH-PWM2S2 module has an object that consists of two LIGHT type channels that read information about the power and time of activation of four identical inputs. The algorithm determines the maximum power read at the inputs, separately for each channel and together with the time of activation, it controls the connected receivers.<p>The current controlled load is returned to the output as the \"current power level\" separately for each channel.<p>The element also has two inputs and two binary outputs (two state) that are separate for each physical input. Opening or closing the contact causes a change in the logic state of the corresponding output.",

Installation, connection and regulation activities should be carried out by qualified personnel who are familiar with the instructions for the maintenance and operation of the module.

Transport, storage and method of use of the module will affect its correct functioning. Installation of the module is not recommended if there are missing parts or the module is damaged or deformed. If the module malfunctions, it should be returned to the manufacturer.",
