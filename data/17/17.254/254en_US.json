  "xopis_sprzet": "The <b>rH-E2</b>is designed to increase the range of elements that cooperate within the F&Home Radio system. It listens to movement on two channels simultaneously: basic and working. If the addressee does not respond to the message, it sends it again which means that it mediates in the exchange between system components located some distance apart.<p><b>INSTALLATION:</b><p>The amplifier should be installed as far as possible from the central unit, but still within good radio range. If more than one amplifier is installed, they should be arranged so that their ranges do not overlap.<p>Correct configuration: Server <-> Amplifier <-> Modules<p>Incorrect configuration: Server <-> Amplifier <-> Amplifier<p>If the amplifier is turned off or loses connection with the server, the modules it serves that are not within range of the server behave as if they are out of range.",
  "xopis": "The rH-E2 module has an object which needs only to be placed on the project and registered in the system. After registration, the module works autonomously and does not need to be set up.",

Installation, connection and regulation activities should be carried out by qualified personnel who are familiar with the instructions for the maintenance and operation of the module. Removing the housing invalidates the guarantee and carries a risk of electrocution. Before commencing installation, the connection wires should be checked to ensure that they are not live. Transport, storage and method of use of the module will affect its correct functioning. Installation of the module is not recommended if there are missing parts or the module is damaged or deformed. If the module malfunctions, it should be returned to the manufacturer.",
