  "xopis_sprzet": "<b>rH-S6</b> has six physical inputs and it can work in two configurations. The inputs can be connected to monostable, potential free contacts or voltage signals of any polarity. The mode is changed by selecting the appropriate connection in the electrical system. The module sends information about the state of the contacts to the system. Communication with the server is by radio.<p>The rH-S6 is particularly suitable for connecting switches, microswitches and alarm control units.",
  "xopis": "The rH-S6 module has an object that consists of 6 inputs and 6 binary (two state) outputs, separate for each physical input. Opening or closing of the contact changes the logic state at the corresponding output. In the second configuration (see table, Installation Mode 2), a voltage or lack of voltage at the input changes the logic state at the corresponding output.<p>The red diode on the main panel lights up when a logical \"1\" is returned to the output while a logical \"0\" extinguishes the diode.",

Installation, connection and regulation activities should be carried out by qualified personnel who are familiar with the instructions for the maintenance and operation of the module.

Transport, storage and method of use of the module will affect its correct functioning. Installation of the module is not recommended if there are missing parts or the module is damaged or deformed. If the module malfunctions, it should be returned to the manufacturer.",
