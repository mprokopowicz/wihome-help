  "xopis_sprzet": "The <b>rH-D1S2</b>is a combination of a dimmer and two contact outputs. The module sends out information about the opening or closing of the contacts to the system. It also controls the 230V AC receiver with a maximum power of 150W. Communication with the server takes place by radio.<p>The module has two physical inputs for the connection of monostable and potential free contacts, as well as one input for the connection of a receiver. The power load on the input can be resistive (incandescent lamps), inductive (AC motors and transformers) or capacitive (fluorescent lamps). Power regulation takes place on the basis of phase modulation with the exception of in phase xxx, within a range of 0-100%. The dimmer has electronic overcurrent protection in the event of a short circuit or the connection of too high a load. In addition, an integral temperature sensor protects the unit against overheating. </p><p>The rH-D1S2 is particularly suitable for controlling lighting, low-power fans and 150W heaters.</p><p><b>AUTONOMOUS MODE:</ b></p><p>If the module loses connection with the server, it goes into autonomous mode and acts like a classic dimmer. A short press of the switch connected to contact 1 switches the dimmer output on or off. Pressing it for longer will increase or decrease the power in increments of 10% between the range of 10-100%. </p><p>Conditions for autonomous mode:<ul><li>Correct connection of the S1 contact with the switch</ li><li> The \"Off-line: autonomous mode\" option in the Installer Settings is enabled.</li></ul></p>",
  "xopis": "The rH-D1S2 module has an object that consists of one LIGHT type channel that reads information about the power and time of activation of four identical inputs. The algorithm determines the maximum power read at the inputs and together with the time of activation, it controls the connected lamp or other receiver.<p>The current controlled load is returned to the output as the \"current power level\".<p>The element also has two inputs and two binary outputs (two state) that are separate for each physical input. Opening or closing of the contact causes a change in the logic state of the corresponding output.",

Control of the signalling LEDs is now carried out by the older version of rH-D1S2.<p>\"Contact active when\" function: The system is based on additive logic which means that the rest state is \"0\" while the active (nonstable) state is \"1\". For a monostable switch (one that has one stable state - an integral spring) the stable state is the inactive state, i.e. there is a logical \"0\" at the object output.<p>\"Maximum active time\" function: Setting the parameter to \"0\" disconnects the automatic output zeroing mechanism. This is most often the case when the contact is treated as bistable (e.g. a microswitch).<p>The dimmer can work in one of 8 modes chosen in the contextual menu or while dropping icons on the project. These modes can be used for the different types of loads that can be controlled by the rH-D1S2.",
