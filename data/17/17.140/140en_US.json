  "xopis_sprzet": "The <b>rH-PWM3</b>controls three low voltage receivers powered from an external source. Power regulation takes place by modulation of the impulse that activates the receiver (PWM). The frequency of the impulses is set in the range 100Hz to 1kHz. The integral temperature sensor protects the module from overheating. Communication with the server takes place by radio.<p>The<b>rH-PWM3</b>is particularly suitable for controlling LEDs, electromagnetic locks and other low voltage regulating elements.",
  "xopis": "The rH-PWM3 module has an object that consists of three LIGHT type channels that read information about the power and time of activation of four identical inputs. The algorithm determines the maximum power read at the inputs, separately for each channel and together with the time of activation, it controls the connected receivers.<p>The current controlled load is returned to the output as the \"current power level\" separately for each channel.",

Installation, connection and regulation activities should be carried out by qualified personnel who are familiar with the instructions for the maintenance and operation of the module. Removing the housing invalidates the guarantee and carries a risk of electrocution. Before commencing installation, the connection wires should be checked to ensure that they are not live. Transport, storage and method of use of the module will affect its correct functioning. Installation of the module is not recommended if there are missing parts or the module is damaged or deformed. If the module malfunctions, it should be returned to the manufacturer.",
