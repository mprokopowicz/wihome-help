  "xopis_sprzet": "The <b>rH-R1S1</b> is a combined transmitter and contact input. The module sends information about the opening and closing of the contacts to the system and controls the relay, which can switch on any electrical circuit. Communication with the server takes place by means of radio.<p>The module has a physical input for the connection of one monostable potential free contact as well as one relay input. The contact load can be resistive, inductive or capacitive, in both AC and DC circuits. The integral temperature sensor protects the module from overheating.<p>The rH-R1S1 is particularly suitable for controlling a ventilation fan and lighting and the activation of wall sockets.<p><b>AUTONOMOUS MODE:</b><p>If the module loses connection with the server it switches to autonomous work mode. Briefly pressing and releasing the switch connected to contact 1 activates or deactivates the relay.<p>The conditions for autonomous mode:<ul><li>Correct connection of the S1 contact with the switch.</li><li>The \"Off-line: autonomous mode\" is activated in the Installer Settings</li></ul>",
  "xopis": "The rH-R1S1 module has an object that consists of one input and one binary (two state) relay output that corresponds with the physical input.<p>The object input controls the relay and returns its operating state to the output.<p>The element also has one input and one binary output (two state) that corresponds with the physical input. Opening or closing of the contact changes the logic state at the output.",

Installation, connection and regulation activities should be carried out by qualified personnel who are familiar with the instructions for the maintenance and operation of the module. Removing the housing invalidates the guarantee and carries a risk of electrocution. Before commencing installation, the connection wires should be checked to ensure that they are not live. Transport, storage and method of use of the module will affect its correct functioning. Installation of the module is not recommended if there are missing parts or the module is damaged or deformed. If the module malfunctions, it should be returned to the manufacturer.",
