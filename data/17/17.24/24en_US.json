Communication with the server takes place by radio.<p>The temperature and brightness sensors are enclosed within the housing. An opening in the housing allows measurement of the brightness levels, but temperature measurement is affected by a time lag.<p><b>rH-T1X1</b>is particularly suitable for supporting the control of temperature and the automatic room lighting by taking readings outside of the building.",
