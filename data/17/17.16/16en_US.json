  "xopis_sprzet": "<b>rH-P1</b>is a low power, passive motion sensor. It detects the presence of people through changes in infrared radiation and transmits each change to the system. Communication with the server takes place by radio.",
  "xopis": "The rH-P1 module has an object that consists of one input and one binary output of the motion sensor. Detecting a person causes a logical \"1\" to be returned at the output. In the resting state, the output returns a logical \"0\".<p>Typical applications include the control of lighting, ventilation or the alarm system.",
