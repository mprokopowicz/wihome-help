  "xopis_sprzet": "<b>rH-R5</b>consists of 5 relays for activating electrical circuits from a common power supply. Communication with the server takes place by radio.<p>The relay contact load can be resistive, inductive or capacitive, in both AC and DC circuits. All relays have one pin connected to a common cable. The integral temperature sensor protects the unit against overheating.<p> Pressing the switch on the housing for less than 1 second will turn all the relays on or off at the same time.",

Installation, connection and regulation activities should be carried out by qualified personnel who are familiar with the instructions for the maintenance and operation of the module. Removing the housing invalidates the guarantee and carries a risk of electrocution. Before commencing installation, the connection wires should be checked to ensure that they are not live. Transport, storage and method of use of the module will affect its correct functioning. Installation of the module is not recommended if there are missing parts or the module is damaged or deformed. If the module malfunctions, it should be returned to the manufacturer.",
