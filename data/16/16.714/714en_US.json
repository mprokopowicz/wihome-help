  "xopis": "The SX 714 indicator is a virtual and animated element, i.e. it changes appearance depending on its logic state. Touch buttons are used in the remote control programme panels, as well as applications for mobile devices and the website. The indicator can be used as both a display and a virtual button. The operating mode determines how the output of the indicator is controlled.",
